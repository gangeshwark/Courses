- Applying linear-regression to classification problems is not a great idea.

- Linear-regression doesn't deal well with outliers.

- Logistic regression is a classification algorithm.

- Logistic function/Sigmoid function is used in Logistic regression

- h(x) = 1/(1+e^(-Theta'*X))

- Interpreting h(x) as estimated probability that y=1 on input x.

- Non linear decision boundaries, you need add higher order polynomials
