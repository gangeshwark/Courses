- When there are few features and the classification problem is non-linear then you can include many polynomial terms
  and deal with the non-linearity. This method doesn't work well when there are large number of features because you might
  end up overfitting and there is a good chance that the model will be computationally expensive.

- Neural networks help out with non-linear hypotheses.
